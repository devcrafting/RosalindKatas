Current implementation was started during a Code Retreat in Lyon on June 13th 2015. 
For the record, we produced the awful legacy code you can see in first commit in one hour under high pressure with a constraint to avoid test ! That was intentional, the goal was to produce legacy code and rework it in next iterations.

I have tried to exercise testing and refactoring of my own legacy code. The result is not fully satisfying for now...but it was really nice to try :).
